                    <li>Add 2 to 2.5 cups of water.</li>
                    <li>
                      Whisk everything to a smooth consistency. There should
                      not be any lumps in this liquid mixture.
                    </li>
                    <li>Making tempering</li>
                    <li>
                      The tempering ingredients are in the below photo. The
                      curry leaves are dry curry leaves.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In a sauce pan or pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil or ghee.
                      Add ½ teaspoon mustard seeds and let them crackle on low
                      heat.<br />
                      Then add the rest of the below-mentioned spices and fry
                      for a minute on low heat. ½ teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 inch
                      cinnamon stick, 2 cloves, 8 to 10 curry leaves, 2 broken
                      dry red chilies – remove the seeds, ¼ teaspoon fenugreek
                      seeds, a generous pinch of asafoetida (hing)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Add the yogurt mixture slowly and carefully as it may
                      splutter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Stir and mix well to combine. On a medium-low to medium
                      heat let the kadhi mixture come to a boil first. Do use
                      a large pan and stir often, so that the kadhi does not
                      spill out or gets browned or stuck at the bottom of the
                      pan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Later let the gujarati kadhi simmer for 5 to 7 minutes
                      more on low to medium-low heat. Stir in between to avoid
                      the lumps from forming. Adjust the salt and sugar as
                      required. Check the taste and there should be no rawness
                      from the besan felt in the kadhi. If there is some
                      rawness from the besan, then simmer for some more
                      minutes as required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Serve Gujarati kadhi hot or warm with steamed basmati
                      rice or phulka or paratha. It makes for a comforting
                      meal with rice served with a side of a vegetable dish,
                      pickle or salad. Any leftovers can be used within a day.
                      On refrigeration the taste and flavor changes.

                      Add water as needed in small incremental quantities and
                      knead a smooth and soft dough like roti dough. Grease
                      its surface with 1-teaspoon oil. Cover the dough with a
                      clean muslin cloth or a plate and leave aside for 15-20
                      minutes. After 15-20 minutes, divide it into 7 equal
                      parts and give them a round shape like ball.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Take 1/2 cup dry wheat flour in a plate for dusting.
                      Take one dough ball, press it in between your palms or

                      Flip it again, spread 1/2 teaspoon oil evenly on its
                      surface and cook other side as well. Press it against
                      tawa/griddle with a spatula so that it cooks evenly,
                      cook for 20-30 seconds. Repeat flip-press-cook process
                      (without spreading any more oil) until light golden
                      brown spots appear on both sides. Switch between low to
                      medium flame as required while cooking it.

                    <li>
                      Transfer it to a plate. Follow the same process for
                      remaining dough balls and cook them in a similar way.

            <p class="card_text">
              Basundi is a popular dessert most commonly made in Western
              India, in such states as Maharashtra and Gujarat. It’s a bit
              similar to Rabdi, which is often served in North India. Enjoy
              basundi as it or with Puri.

                  <h2>Ingredients For The Basundi</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      ½ can sweetened condensed milk – 200 grams or ½ cup + 2
                      tablespoons
                    </li>
                    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                    <li>
                      ½ teaspoon cardamom powder or 4 to 5 green cardamoms,
                      powdered in a mortar-pestle
                    </li>
                    <li>6 cashews – slivered or chopped</li>

                    <li>10 pistachios – slivered or chopped, unsalted</li>
                    <li>8 almonds – slivered or chopped</li>
                    <li>10 to 12 saffron strands</li>
                    <li>2 to 3 pinches grated nutmeg or nutmeg powder</li>

                    <li>2 tablespoons chironji (charoli seeds)</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h2>Steps</h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Firstly, take ½ a can of condensed milk (200 grams) or ½
                      cup + 2 tablespoons in a heavy skillet or thick bottomed
                      saucepan or kadai (wok).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Add 2 cups of whole milk. Do not use low-fat or skimmed
                      milk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      NOTE: How much milk is needed depends on how much sugar
                      is in the sweetened condensed milk you use. Start with 2
                      cups of milk, and add more as needed after the sweetened
                      condensed milk has been added.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      With a whisk mix well enough to combine the thick
                      condensed milk with whole milk to get an even liquid.<br />
                      The mixture should be even or else the condensed milk at
                      the bottom can burn while cooking. So make sure there is
                      no condensed milk at the bottom of the pan. All the
                      condensed milk should be mixed with the milk.
                    </li>
                    <li>Switch on the heat and keep it to a low.</li>

                    <li>
                      . Place pan on the stove-top and simmer for 20 to 25
                      minutes. Stir after intervals of 3 to 4 minutes on low
                      heat.<br />

                      Continue to stir often as you bring the mixture to a
                      gentle boil. Be careful to not let the milk brown on the
                      bottom of the pot.
                      <br />
                      As it cooks, use a rubber spatula or wooden spatula to
                      scrape the sides of the pan and stir the milk solids
                      back into the basundi mixture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Meanwhile chop the nuts and set them aside. Add your
                      choice of chopped nuts. My favorite nuts to include are:
                      cashews, pistachios, almonds.Here I have slivered 6
                      cashews, 10 pistachios and 8 almonds. You can add more
                      or less of each of the nuts.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      The basundi mixture will begin to thicken as you
                      continue to cook it. After it simmers for 20 to 25
                      minutes the basundi should be slightly thick but smooth
                      and creamy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the slivered nuts.</li>

                    <li>
                      Grate nutmeg to get a pinch of it or add a generous
                      pinch of ground nutmeg powder.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder (4 green cardamom pods,
                      powdered in a mortar-pestle) and 10 to 12 strands of
                      saffron. Also add 2 tablespoons of chironji (charoli
                      seeds).<br />

                      Make sure that the chironji are fresh and not rancid or
                      tasting bitter. As they get rancid very quickly.<br />

                      Chironji is also known as charoli and these small brown
                      seeds give a lovely crunch and a nuttiness to this
                      creamy dessert.
                    </li>
                    <li>Stir to mix and simmer it for another minute.</li>
                    <li>
                      Transfer basundi to serving bowl/bowls. Serve this
                      creamy dessert hot, warm or chilled garnished with some
                      almond and pistachio slivers. If you plan to serve
                      basundi cold, then cover the bowl or bowls and
                      refrigerate for a few hours until the basundi becomes
                      cold.<br />
                      Store leftovers in the fridge for 2 to 3 days in a
                      covered container or bowl. Enjoy basundi as it or with
                      Puri (Indian fry bread)

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Take 2½ cups water in a deep pan. Add cumin seeds,
                      sesame seeds, green chillies, baking soda and salt and
                      boil it over medium flame for a minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Now gradually add rice flour (1-2 tablespoons at a time)
                      while stirring continuously using wooden spatula.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      As the flour is getting mixed with water, it will start
                      to thicken. Make sure that there are no lumps of flour.
                      Slowly add and mix entire rice flour and it will start
                      getting soft dough like consistency.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Cook for a minute and turn off flame. Transfer it to a
                      plate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Pour 1-glass water in steamer and bring it to boil over
                      medium flame. (If you do not have steamer then take a
                      deep vessel and boil water in it.)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Place prepared dough in a steamer container, place it
                      inside the steamer, cover with a lid and steam-cook for
                      about 8 minutes. Turn off flame, open the lid and let it
                      cool for 2-3 minutes. (If you are not using steamer then
                      take prepared dough in colander and place it over deep
                      vessel having boiling water in it. Cover it with a plate
                      and steam cook for about 8 minutes. Turn off the flame,
                      remove plate and allow it to cool for 2-3 minutes)

                    <li>¼ teaspoon ground mustard (mustard powder)</li>

                      8 to 10 bread slices – whole wheat, brown, white or

                <div>
                  <h2>Steps</h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      In a mixing bowl take ⅓ cup grated carrots and ¼ cup
                      finely chopped bell pepper (capsicum). You can also add
                      veggies like some steamed corn kernels, steamed green
                      peas and shredded cabbage at this step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Add one medium-sized potato, which has been boiled,
                      peeled and chopped. The addition of potatoes are
                      optional but I do recommend adding them as they make the
                      sandwiches filling and hearty. They also give a good
                      texture and taste.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Add ⅓ cup Veg Mayonnaise. You can use your preferred
                      brand of eggless or vegan mayonnaise. Instead of mayo
                      you can use greek yogurt or thick sour cream.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Add ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper and ¼
                      teaspoon ground mustard (mustard powder).<br />
                      If you do not have ground mustard, then simply crush ⅛
                      teaspoon mustard seeds in a mortar pestle. Or you can
                      add ¼ teaspoon dijon mustard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Mix very well. For a slightly sweet taste, you can also
                      add ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar. But do keep in mind that if
                      your mayo has a more sweet taste then don’t add
                      sugar.<br />
                      If you want, you can also add some red chili flakes or
                      some dried herbs like oregano, thyme, basil.
                    </li>

                    <li>Spread butter on the bread slices.</li>
                    <li>Now spread the stuffing on the bread slices.</li>
                    <li>
                      Place on top the remaining buttered slices and slice the
                      sandwich in rectangles or triangles or small squares. At
                      this point, if you’d like, you can toast or grill these
                      sandwiches.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      While serving the veg mayonnaise sandwiches you can
                      garnish them with some grated carrots and grated cheddar

                    <h2>For Masala Lassi</h2>

                    <li>2 cups Curd – cold and fresh (yogurt)
                    </li>
                    <li>3 to 4 green cardamoms – seeds crushed in mortar and husks removed</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon crushed black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 to 2 pinches grated nutmeg or ground nutmeg</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons chopped almonds or cashews or pistachios</li>
                    <li>10 to 12 saffron strands – optional</li>
                    <li>5 to 6 tablespoons chopped palm sugar (palm jaggery) or jaggery or sugar</li>
                    <li>⅓ to ½ cup water – cold or at room temperature, add as required</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h2>Steps</h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Before you begin ensure that the whole milk curd (yogurt) is fresh and not gone sour. I always make lassi with homemade curd.
<br><br>
                      After the curd is well set and done, I keep it in the refrigerator for a few hours so that it gets cold.</li>
                    <li>First, in a mortar, take 8 to 10 green cardamom pods and crush them lightly. Then remove the husk and crush the seeds.<br><br>

                      You can skip these first two steps if using pre-made ground cardamom. Add about 1 teaspoon of ground cardamom to yogurt while blending.
                    </li>
                    <li>Now crush the seeds to a fine powder.<br><br>Then in a bowl or pan, take 2 cups fresh chilled yogurt or homemade curd.
                    </li>

                    <li> Next, with a handheld wooden churner (called madani in Hindi) or an immersion blender or a wired whisk, whip the curd until it becomes smooth.
                    </li>

                    <li> The curd should be smooth before you add other ingredients to it.<br><br>Now add 4 to 5 tablespoons sugar or as needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour 1 cup cold water or cold milk if you prefer. For a thicker lassi, add ½ cup of water or milk or do not add any liquids. For a thinner consistency, add 1.5 cups water or milk.</li>
                    <li> Now begin to churn or blend the lassi mixture with the wooden churner or immersion blender or wired whisk</li>
                    <li>Keep on churning, blending or whisking until the sugar dissolves and you see a nice frothy layer on top.<br><br>
                      Apart from using using a wired whisk or an immersion blender, another method is to add the lassi ingredients in a blender. Then blend until smooth and frothy.</li>
                    <li>In the below photo you can see a good frothy layer on top.</li>
                    <li>Now add 1 teaspoon of the crushed cardamom powder and 10 to 12 crushed saffron strands.<br> Mix well. Do a taste test and add more sugar if needed.</li>
                    <li>Pour lassi in tall glasses and serve. You can add ice cubes to your lassi if you prefer.<br><br>

                      Garnish with a pinch or two of ground cardamom powder, 2 to 3 crushed saffron strands or chopped nuts. Serve this sweet lassi recipe straightaway.<br><br>
                      
                      Some people store it in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. If you plan to keep it in the refrigerator then do not add ice cubes.</li>

                      <h2>Steps for Masala Lassi Recipe</h2>
                      <li>In a blender take 2 cups chilled curd (yogurt), crushed seeds from 3 to 4 green cardamons, ¼ teaspoon crushed black pepper, 1 to 2 pinches of grated nutmeg, 2 tablespoons chopped almonds or cashews or pistachios or a mix of all three nuts.</li>
                      <li>Add 10 to 12 saffron strands and 5 to 6 tablespoons chopped palm sugar (palm jaggery) or jaggery or sugar. Add about ⅓ to ½ cup water.</li>
                      <li>Blend until smooth and frothy. Check the taste and if needed add more palm sugar and blend again. Serve straightaway topped with a few saffron strands or chopped nuts.</li>

                  <h2>Steps</h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Firstly, add 1 tablespoon of instant coffee to a bowl. If using brewed filter coffee or espresso you can add ¼ cup directly to the blender jar as shown in step 3 below.</li>
                    <li> Add ¼ cup of warm water (not hot) to the instant coffee. Stir and mix very well.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the coffee solution to a blender jar.
                    </li>
                    <li> Next add 3 to 4 tablespoons of sugar.</li>
                    <li>Blend for a minute or until the coffee solution becomes frothy and the color fades to a lighter shade of brown.</li>
                    <li> Add 6 or 7 ice cubes. For a thicker blended cold coffee use just 2 to 4 cubes of ice.</li>
                    <li> Then pour in 2 cups of cold or chilled milk. To make this recipe, I used whole milk. See FAQs below for low fat cold coffee tips.</li>
                    <li>Blend once for again just a few seconds, until everything is mixed well and you get a nice frothy and foamy layer on top.</li>
                    <li>Pour into tall glasses and serve cold coffee immediately. The frothy top layer will settle into the beverage as it sits, so it’s best to enjoy blended iced coffee right away.</li>
