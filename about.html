    <h1>About Indian Food</h1>
    <p>
      India food like its culture is varied and is quite popular across the
      world. Indian food is the blend of varied herbs and spices which make
      every dish quite unique and special. Though most of the countries love
      Indian food, it is considered to be quite spicy when compared to the
      other cuisines. Most of them when they think of Indian food, all they
      can think of is the wide variety available. Be it the sweets or the rice
      dishes or the curries or the snacks, Indian cuisine has it all. Indian
      food is delicious and quite exciting and includes the use of various
      exotic flavors. Also, another thing that pops up in our mind when we
      think of Indian cuisine is the wonderful spices that are used in
      cooking.
